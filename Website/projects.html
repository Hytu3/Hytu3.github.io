            <h2>Canvas Chatbot</h2>
            <p>The project is a chatbot designed to help students navigate platforms like Canvas, Google Classroom, or Blackboard. The chatbot assists students by providing quick access to information, such as upcoming assignments, grades, and messages from teachers. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>A canvas chatbot can be very beneficial as the canvas interface can be very complex. In many ways the canvas user interface isn't the best as it has many different options and links such as dashboard, calendar, groups, account courses and etc. In this case for many new users, it can be very easy to lose track of when assignments are due and when announcement are made. The canvas chatbot can fix that by prompting the user if they want to see grades, assignments or messages and show them the information rather than the user going through the complex canvas interface to find them. </p>

            <h2>Online Study</h2>
            <p>Our group went looking for resources talking about the impacts of chatbots, artificial intelligence, and information about opinions on school applications such as Canvas and Blackboard and etc. </p>

            <h2>Prototyping Phase</h2>
            <p>Two prototypes were developed for this project. One that was an AI driven chatbot and another that was a keyword based chatbot. Once both were developed it was decided after user study 1 that the keyword based chatbot was what we were going to move forward with as it had really good feedback.  </p>

            <h2>The MazeRunner</h2>
            <p>The MazeRunner is a fully functioning game which requires users to navigate across a randomly generated maze! </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How it was built?</h2>
            <p>The MazeRunner was built on Visual Studio Code taking advantage of the java swing library! The maze itself was coded in java by using a recursive backtracking algorithm! </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>The player spawns in the middle of the maze from a set starting point and must navigate towards a set ending point. Players can navigate throughout the maze using arrows. Once you reach the ending point a victory panel shows up which is titled victory royale. </p>
